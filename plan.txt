--- PLAN ---

1.
Basic SLAM for keyframe extraction based on OV2SLAM w/o loop closing:
- Feature extraction
- Feature tracking (optical flow)
- Mapping
- Bundle-adjustment (pose, local and full)

2.
Loop closing:
- OBIndex2
- iBoW-LCD

3. Add "uncertainty" metric for a keyframe:
- reprojection error

4. Add ability to replace keyframes with big uncertainty on the fly:

- show keyframes with big uncertainty on the map
- auto-detection of a better keyframe and its replacement
- [?] show path in a map to the keyframe

5. Replace basic filtering with AdaLAM.

6. Reconstruction:
- using in-house code
or
- offloading to 3rd party applications (COLMAP, RealityCapture).
